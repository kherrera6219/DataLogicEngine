>> USER: Research the 87 pl levels and map the members for each level

>> ASSISTANT: To clarify your request about the '87 PL levels,' could you please confirm:

1. Are you referring to 'PL' as 'Professional Levels' in a specific competency framework?
2. Should the mapping of members be drawn from a particular document or system (e.g., from the AKF or YAML file you uploaded)?
3. What type of mapping are you expecting—names of individuals, job roles, or skill sets per level?

This will help me structure the data appropriately.

>> USER: Piller levels 

>> ASSISTANT: Got it. I’ll compile a detailed list of the 87 Pillar Levels (PL levels) and identify the members or roles associated with each level. I’ll map out this structure clearly for your review and let you know when it’s ready.
