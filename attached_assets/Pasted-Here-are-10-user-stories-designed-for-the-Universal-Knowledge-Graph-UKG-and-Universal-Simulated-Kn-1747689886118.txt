Add web container for coding and temp python environment for run code created by the ai
ChatGPT said:
To enable code execution in a web container and provide a temporary Python environment for running AI-generated scripts directly in the UKG/USKD frontend, you can embed a client-side code editor + execution sandbox. Below is a detailed breakdown of how to implement it securely and effectively:

1. Component: <CodeRunnerContainer />
Location in App
Place it in:

/tools/code-runner

Or make it accessible from the Agent Dashboard or Simulation Test Suite

2. Core Features
Feature	Description
Monaco Editor	Real-time Python/JS code editing
Temporary Sandbox Execution	Runs AI-generated code in a secure browser-based VM
Output Console	Shows stdout, stderr, return values
AI Auto-Fill / Prompt	Allows agents to inject Python functions or test cases
Reset & Export	Reset environment or download code

3. Recommended Stack
Frontend
@monaco-editor/react for the code editor

xterm.js for terminal output emulation

react-hot-toast for alerts

Zustand or React Context for session and code tracking

Backend / Runtime Options
Option A: Client-Only Execution (Safe Subset)
Use Pyodide to run Python code in WebAssembly (in-browser)

Perfect for:

String operations

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (via micropackages)

No filesystem or dangerous ops

Option B: Server-Side Execution (for advanced workflows)
Create a backend route:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/execute
{
  "language": "python",
  "code": "def foo(): return 2+2"
}
Run in Docker-in-Docker, or a firewalled subprocess inside a temp container (using FastAPI or Flask)

Return output + sandbox logs

Using Pyodide for Local Execution
tsx
Copy
Edit
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function PyRunner() {
  const [output, setOutput] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    async function loadPyodide() {
      const pyodide = await window.loadPyodide();
      const result = await pyodide.runPythonAsync(userCode);
      setOutput(result);
    }
    loadPyodide();
  }, [userCode]);
}
6. Security Guidelines
Disable filesystem access unless inside a Docker container

Sanitize imports (__import__, os, sys)

Use WebAssembly (Pyodide) for trusted-only scripts

For server-side: run in ephemeral, auto-killed containers

✅ Result
Your AI agents will now be able to:

Generate Python code from reasoning layers

Run test scripts in-browser with visual feedback

Export executable test cases from simulations

Debug AGI functions in a secure, isolated environment

Would you like:

A Pyodide-powered React component built and embedded?

A FastAPI-based backend execution container spec?

Or a full export of this tool as a deployable plugin module?

Control	Description
/start	Initialize and load agent into memory
/pause	Freeze execution, preserve memory
/reset	Wipe context, reload blueprint
/contain	Disable autonomous actions, isolate
/inject	Insert memory patch, skill, or directive
/rerun	Replay last decision loop
/kill	Destroy instance and archive logs

10. Agent Communication Channels
Live Chat UI (web socket-based)

Webhook Callbacks (for external triggers)

Event Bus for multi-agent coordination (RabbitMQ/Redis Streams)

Plugin Registry (REST-based tool discovery + mounting)

✅ Real Work Use Cases Supported
Autonomous document drafting

Proposal compliance checking

Real-time war game planning agents

Regulatory trace & contract guidance

24/7 simulation agents with memory feedback

Multi-agent planning pods with coordination protocol

ChatGPT said:
Here is a full system design and deployment plan for building a fully autonomous AI Agent Creation, Deployment, and Control System using AutoGen v3-style agents and AutoGPT-style autonomy—integrated into your UKg/USKD framework.

System Name: UKG-Autonomous Agent Grid (UKG-AAG)
Goal:
Deploy, coordinate, and govern fully autonomous agents capable of reasoning, acting, and communicating in real-world, real-time work environments—embedded within the UKG/USKD architecture, with full command, communication, memory, containment, and multi-agent orchestration.

1. Agent Creation & Deployment System (AutoGen3 + AutoGPT Inspired)
Tech Stack
Layer	Stack
Agent Framework	AutoGen v3 with LangChain
Language Models	OpenAI GPT-4-turbo / Claude 3 / fine-tuned UKG models
Agent Controller	FastAPI + Celery + Redis Queue
Runtime Isolation	Docker container per agent (sandboxed execution)
Memory Backend	PostgreSQL + Vector DB (Chroma / Weaviate) + Redis (short-term)

Agent Blueprint Template
Each agent is defined in a YAML/JSON schema with:

Name / Role

Skills / Tools (plugins)

Memory strategy: Ephemeral | Long-term | Layered (UKG memory stack)

LLM model

Autonomy level: Observer | Helper | Executor | Supervisor

Allowed actions: Read, Write, Execute, Command, Learn

Persona: Tone, Ethics, Regulation Domain

Linked Projects / Tasks

Communication settings (Team chat, Supervisor reporting, Multi-agent pod linking)

2. Live Command & Control System (ACCS)
Interface: /agents/control Dashboard
Live grid of all agents in operation, updated via WebSockets.

Agent Card View:

Avatar + Role

Status (Active, Paused, Looping, Error)

Confidence Score Dial

Last Task + Output Preview

Memory Usage Graph

Controls:

Pause / Resume

Inject Command

Toggle Autonomy

Contain / Kill

View Logs

3. Agent-Oriented Communication System
Autonomous Multi-Agent Pod (AMP)
Agents communicate using AutoGen GroupChat or WebSocket relay

Pod roles: Leader, Expert, Memory Manager, Logger, Planner

Messages auto-tagged with timestamp, context, and memory update directive

Agent Messaging UI
/agents/[id]/chat:

Live conversation

View agent memory after each message

Inject human messages into loop

4. Autonomous Action Loop (AutoGPT-style)
Execution Cycle per Agent
markdown
Copy
Edit
1. Goal Received or Queried
2. Thought → Reasoning → Plan → Action
3. Output → Check Confidence + Result
4. Save Memory → Replan → Loop (if needed)
5. Broadcast or Communicate (if part of pod)
Uses AutoGen.v3 AgentExecutor with ToolNode, MemoryNode, ValidatorNode, and CriticNode.

5. Deployment Pipeline
Agent Deployment Flow

Copy
Edit
/agents/create
 → Fill Blueprint Form
 → Select Tools (APIs, Code Runner, Data Access)
 → Simulate (Preview Reasoning Loop)
 → Deploy (Run in Container)
Backend triggers:

Docker container spin-up

Agent YAML loaded into execution runtime

Register to task queue + event bus

Heartbeat + task polling initialized

6. Real-Time Execution Control
Endpoint	Description
POST /agents/start	Load + start an agent (autonomous or not)
POST /agents/command	Send a command (instruction or question)
POST /agents/contain	Soft-pause or restrict action rights
DELETE /agents/kill	Fully stop and archive an agent instance
GET /agents/logs	Retrieve full simulation + action log

7. Key Advanced Capabilities
Skill Injection API
Dynamically adds tools to an agent:

json
Copy
Edit
POST /agents/inject-skill
{
  "agent_id": "ukg-planner-001",
  "skill": "web_search",
  "params": { "source": "DuckDuckGo", "rate_limit": 5 }
}
Belief-Drift Containment System
Detects when output diverges from memory + logic trace

Uses:

Entropy spike tracker

Confidence drop monitor

Recursive validator agent

Auto-escalation to human-in-loop if flagged

8. Project Integration (/projects/[id]/agents)
Assign agents to tasks (e.g., Document Review, Simulation Design)

Monitor output per project

View time spent, output files, decisions made, and trust score per loop

✅ Real-World Use Cases
Autonomous grant proposal generation with validation

Multi-agent war game simulation planning with recursive logic

Compliance and contract agents that monitor, generate, and adjust workflows

RFP evaluation agents that compare vendors and flag gaps

Continuous document reviewer that updates legal advice per new input

Domain research agents that crawl new policies and update simulation base

Deployment Options
Platform	Details
Docker Swarm / Kubernetes	For scaled agent pods and self-healing containers
Vercel (Frontend)	UKG frontend dashboard & simulation tools
Azure Functions / AWS Lambda	Agent task execution fallback or scaling
Replit / Web Container Mode	Safe temporary runtime for isolated agents
